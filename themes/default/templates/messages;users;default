This message has been sent to to verify your registration and the associated email address.

Your password has been set to: [% newpasswd %].  Go to the URL below to log in:

<[% gSkin.absolutedir %]/index.pl?op=userlogin&upasswd=[% newpasswd %]&unickname=[% tempnick | fixparam %]&returnto=%2Flogin.pl%3Fop=changeprefs>

Make sure you then CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  If you have any problems
with or suggestions for improving this procedure feel free to email the 
administrator ([% constants.adminmail %]).

[% CASE 'mailpasswd_msg' %]

Your new password is [% newpasswd %].  Your old password will still work until
this password is used.  Go to the URL below to log in:

<[% gSkin.absolutedir %]/index.pl?op=userlogin&upasswd=[% newpasswd %]&unickname=[% tempnick | fixparam %]&returnto=%2Flogin.pl%3Fop=changeprefs>

Make sure you then CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!

If you have received this message without having requested it, it is
because someone attempted to use your username or e-mail address.  It
was mostly likely an innocent mistake, and they are not getting your
password, so you can safely disregard this message.

Thanks.

In case you get multiple emails you didn't request, the requester's IP
was [% remote_ip %].[% IF user_agent %]  Its User-Agent was
"[% user_agent %]"
(not that you should trust that value, but it might be interesting).[% END %]
[% IF x_forwarded_for %]In case that's a properly-configured proxy,
the value of its X-Real-IP header was "[% x_forwarded_for %]" --
but don't trust that value unless you know a reason to (we don't).[% END %]

<p>This is <b>your</b> User Info page.  There are thousands more, but
this one is yours.  You most likely are not so interested in yourself,

change your password, or just click pretty widgets to kill time.
