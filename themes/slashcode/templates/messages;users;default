Your new password is [% newpasswd %].  Your old password will still work until
this password is used.  Go to the URL below to log in:

<[% constants.absolutedir %]/index.pl?op=userlogin&upasswd=[% newpasswd %]&unickname=[% tempnick %]&returnto=%2Fusers.pl%3Fop=changepasswd>

Make sure you then CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!

If you have received this message without having requested it, it is
because someone attempted to use your username or e-mail address.  It
was mostly likely an innocent mistake, and they are not getting your
password, so you can safely disregard this message.

Thanks.

this one is yours.  You most likely are not so interested in yourself,

up top there, where you can customize [% constants.sitename %],
change your password, or just click pretty widgets to kill time.
