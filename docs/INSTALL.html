<P>INSTALL - Slash Installation</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P>This document describes how to install Slash 2.1/2.2 (where you see
"2.2" you may safely assume "2.1", except where specified).  For instructions on
installation or upgrade of previous versions of Slash, see the INSTALL
document included with those distributions.</P>
<P>These instructions have only been tested on Linux. Installation under
BSD and other Unix OSes should work similarly, but there are problems
with the Makefile and installtion under some non-Linux OSes.  Feel free
to submit bug reports (better, patches) for any such problems.
We've had reports of the 1.0.x version of Slash running on Windows,
but have done no testing and have no further information, and have no
information about Slash 2 running on Windows.</P>
<P>PostgreSQL support in Slash 2 is currently alpha-quality.</P>
<P>Slash can always be downloaded from SourceForge.net, from the FTP site,
and via CVS.</P>

<P>The software and hardware requirements are listed at the end of the

Please read those requirements if you have <STRONG>any</STRONG> question about
what might be required.</P>

<UL>
<LI>
For slashd (see <EM>utils/slash</EM>, which starts slashd),
mod_perl (see <EM>httpd/httpd.conf</EM>), and MySQL, we set all processes
to run in GMT.  Then it is easy to convert dates to whatever the
user's local time is.  If you have date offset problems, check that all of
these are properly set to run in GMT.
<P></P>
<LI>
You cannot have different versions of the Slash modules installed for
different sites on the same Apache server.  Well, if you want to, you
can try the Apache::PerlVINC module, but this is <STRONG>not</STRONG> recommended for
performance reasons. Slash is designed to have one shared core of code
for all Slash sites on a system.  (This is made easier than it was in
1.0.x, where to customize a site, you needed to change the module code;
this should no longer be necessary.)
<P></P>
<LI>
All of the installation steps below should be executed as root.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="installation_procedure">Installation Procedure</A></H2>
<P>There are six steps to installation.  Skip the parts you already
have installed (making sure you have the correct versions).  Make sure
to read the special note about Apache / mod_perl installation.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install MySQL.</STRONG>
<P>Please refer to MySQL documentation for compilation
and/or installation notes for any questions with this process.  Find
the script that runs mysql (probably <EM>safe_mysqld</EM>) and add these
lines to the beginning of it:</P>
<PRE>
        TZ=GMT
        export TZ</PRE>
<P>Start MySQL (it must be running for the installation of Perl modules
and Slash).</P>
<P>Create a database to be used by Slash.</P>
<P>Create a username/password that can access that database (by
default, we normally set the user to have all permissions, but that
might not be appropriate for your site; make sure that you have
at least privileges to select, insert, update, delete, create,
drop, and index).</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install perl.</STRONG>
<P>perl is likely already installed on your machine; make sure its
version is at least the minimum required (see <A HREF="#requirements">REQUIREMENTS</A>).</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install Apache and mod_perl.</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>You MUST install mod_perl and Apache as directed here</STRONG>.  OK, that is
not strictly true, but it is <EM>mostly</EM> true.  If you already have mod_perl
installed, it is probably not configured properly to work with Slash
and you will have to rebuild it.  [If you are using the provided httpd.conf
file from the slash distribution, and find that Apache is giving you errors,
chances are mod_perl is not installed correctly, and you need to build it
from scratch.]  Of course, if you have your own Apache modules or build
options, you will need to modify the instructions here appropriately.</P>
<P>First, untar apache and mod_perl.  Then, go to the mod_perl directory,
and have mod_perl build and install apache for you:</P>
<PRE>
        perl Makefile.PL APACHE_SRC=/where_you_have_the_source DO_HTTPD=1 \
                USE_APACI=1 PERL_MARK_WHERE=1 EVERYTHING=1 \
                APACHE_PREFIX=/where_apache_will_be_installed
        make
        make test
        make install</PRE>
<P><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: You may be unsuccessful with <CODE>make test</CODE> if the perl modules
are not yet installed.  However, some Perl modules will not install
without Apache and mod_perl installed.  If you wish, come back and
run <CODE>make test</CODE> after installing here, and then installing the Perl
modules, to make sure everything is OK.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install the Perl modules.</STRONG>
<P>The best way to do this is with the CPAN module.</P>
<P>You might also wish to install each module by hand, using distributions
found on the CPAN.  See <EM>perlmodinstall</EM>
for more information on installing perl modules.</P>
<P><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTES</STRONG>:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Overactive_CPAN"><STRONG>Overactive CPAN</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
With some versions of the CPAN module, the module will try to
download and install the latest version of Perl.  Watch what
the module is doing; if it begins to download an entire perl
distribution, interrupt it (hit ctrl-C) until it stops, then try
again with the CPAN module.  This should not be an issue in the latest
version of Bundle::Slash.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Uninstalling_Old_Modules"><STRONG>Uninstalling Old Modules</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Sometimes, you will be installing a newer version of a module that
exists elsewhere on the system.  You might want to tell the CPAN module
to automatically remove older files.  To do that from the CPAN shell,
type:
<PRE>
        cpan&gt; o conf make_install_arg UNINST=1</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Old_Version"><STRONG>Old Version</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If you have previously installed Bundle::Slash, you will want
to install it again, but you will need to delete the existing
version.  Go to your <EM>.cpan/Bundle</EM> directory (usually
<EM>~/.cpan/Bundle/</EM>) and remove <EM>Slash.pm</EM>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Additional_Libraries"><STRONG>Additional Libraries</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
You must have certain libraries existing on your system before
building, for Compress::Zlib and XML::Parser (see <A HREF="#requirements">REQUIREMENTS</A>).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_BSD"><STRONG>BSD</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If running BSD, also install the BSD::Resource module.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Alternate_DBs"><STRONG>Alternate DBs</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If not using MySQL, just allow the installation of its drivers
to continue, and possibly fail.  Then install the driver you need
(e.g., for PostgreSQL, use "DBD::Pg") using the CPAN shell.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_DBIx%3A%3APassword"><STRONG>DBIx::Password</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
When installing DBIx::Password, you will be asked for various
information, the same information used to create the database
and database user in Step 1.  You will also be asked for a
<STRONG>virtual user</STRONG> name, which will be the identifier for all of
this data.  You can just use the name of your site,
or any other alphanumeric string.  You will use this virtual
user name in other places, so do not forget it.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_libnet_Broken"><STRONG>libnet Broken</STRONG></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
libnet is currently broken somewhat in its tests.  Please use
<CODE>install Net::Cmd</CODE> first, before you install anything else.
If it fails only tests 8 and 9 of t/require, then it is OK;
just do <CODE>force install Net::Cmd</CODE>, then continue on with the
rest of the modules installation.
<P></P></DL>
<P>To use the CPAN module, invoke the CPAN shell:</P>
<PRE>
        perl -MCPAN -e shell</PRE>
<P>After it has been configured, install Bundle::Slash:</P>
<PRE>
        cpan&gt; install Bundle::Slash</PRE>
<P>To read the README for any module, before or after installing:</P>
<PRE>
        cpan&gt; readme MODULE</PRE>
<P>If you have problems, feel free to re-run <CODE>install Bundle::Slash</CODE>.  It
will safely skip anything already installed.</P>
<P>To read the documentation of any of the modules, once they have been
installed, type <CODE>perldoc MODULE</CODE> at the command line.</P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install Slash.</STRONG>
<P>Unpack the distribution and go to the new directory that
creates, and type:</P>
<PRE>
        make
        make install</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: you will want the GNU versions of fileutils (version
4.0 recommended, for cp and install) and make.  Older versions of
install, and make and cp from other systems, might not work.</P>
<P>There are a few options to <CODE>make</CODE> and <CODE>make install</CODE> you may
want to change.</P>
<PRE>

<P>(USER and GROUP will also be changed later on a per-site basis,
in step 6. while running <EM>install-slashsite</EM>.)</P>
<P>So, for example, you might type (although the default SLASH_PREFIX
is <EM>strongly</EM> recommended):</P>
<PRE>
        make SLASH_PREFIX=/home/slash
        make install SLASH_PREFIX=/home/slash</PRE>
<P>When done, a configuration file for Apache will be created at
<EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf</EM>.  You can put its contents into your
httpd.conf, or you can just <CODE>Include</CODE> it in your httpd.conf.</P>
<P><STRONG>WARNING!</STRONG></P>
<P>Please be aware that if you include <EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf</EM>
or <EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/sites/sitename/sitename.conf</EM> more than once,
or if this file shares contents with directives in httpd.conf,
that your Slash site WILL break. The directives in
<EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf</EM> should be run only ONCE in any any
site context.  Read through <EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf</EM> to make
sure it all looks proper.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install your Slash site.</STRONG>
<P>Go to your installation directory (by default, <EM>/usr/local/slash</EM>)
and execute (where <CODE>VIRTUAL_USER</CODE> is the name of the virtual
user given in the DBIx::Password distribution):</P>
<PRE>
        bin/install-slashsite -u VIRTUAL_USER</PRE>
<P>The program will prompt for answers to several configuration questions.
Answer the questions.  When done, another configuration
file will be created at <EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/$SITENAME/$SITENAME.conf</EM>.
You can put its contents unto your httpd.conf, or you can just <CODE>Include</CODE>
it in your httpd.conf.</P>
<P><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Read the message printed at the end of running install_slashsite.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Start it up.</STRONG>
<P>After installation of the site is done, and Apache has been stopped
and started (do NOT try to restart Apache, but do a full stop and
start), run slashd.  This should be done via the init script:</P>
<PRE>
        /etc/init.d/slash start</PRE>
<P>slashd is the daemon that runs routine maintenance on Slash sites,
including sending out daily mailings, cleaning up the database,
and updating stories.  The init script above will start up an
individual slashd daemon process process for each installed site.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="multiple_servers">Multiple Servers</A></H2>
<P>You can, of course, have a separate database server from your Slash
server.  Further, you can have multiple web servers for one Slash site.
Slashdot, for instance, has one primary server with all of the code
(Apache, perl, etc.), and it runs slashd and NFS.  Each
web server then mounts the code read-only over NFS.  Some notes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Make sure the MySQL server allows the user to log in from each web
server, and the NFS server.
<P></P>
<LI>
Make sure, if you use the same httpd tree on all machines, that
the httpd.conf is listening to the proper IP addresses.  This can be
done by putting all of the IP addresses in the conf file, or by having
a separate Listen file on each machine.  Similarly, make sure that
each web server's logfiles unique to each machine, not written to the
NFS volumes.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="virtual_hosts">Virtual Hosts</A></H2>
<P>Slash has support for virtual hosts, so you can have multiple
Slash sites on one machine.  Simply execute step 6 in the install
process for each Slash site (after adding a new virtual user to
DBIx::Password for each).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ssl">SSL</A></H2>
<P>In Slash, there are two variables for the root URL of the site.
<STRONG>absolutedir</STRONG> is the full URL, including protocol, while <STRONG>rootdir</STRONG>
is the URL without protocol:</P>
<PRE>
        absolutedir     <A HREF="http://slashcode.com">http://slashcode.com</A>
        rootdir         //slashcode.com</PRE>
<P><STRONG>absolutedir</STRONG> is used only for creating external links to the site
(such as in RSS files).  <STRONG>rootdir</STRONG> is used for internal links; that
way, you can use the same HTML pages for SSL and non-SSL.  You don't
have to do anything special to the code or preferences to allow it to
work with SSL by itself, SSL and non-SSL together, or non-SSL by itself.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="nonroot">Non-Root</A></H2>
<P>It is possible to install and run everything here without root.</P>
<P>Describing the process for a non-root install would take up significant
space and time, having to account for differences in various systems,
and all the workarounds necessary for it to work.</P>
<P>If you must have a non-root install, consult the various documentation
for Apache, MySQL, and perl about running and installing without root
access.  Then, for Slash, you simply need to set the make variables PREFIX,
SLASH_PREFIX, and INIT appropriately for your needs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: Slash (or, more accurately, Apache + mod_perl and MySQL) take
up a lot of system resources.  It is <EM>not advisable</EM> for anyone to
run Slash at all on a system, without the permission of the administrator
of that system.</P>

If you made changes by hand via the web, you are done.  Otherwise, take
the list of templates to update, and pass the full filenames to
template-tool (this will either be the templates you modified by hand
in the dump directory, or the unmodified ones in the installation
directories). You might need to put each filename in quotes because of
the ";" character in the filenames.  This will overwrite your existing
template with the new template.

It is a program that will convert your database from Slash 1.0

<P>There are no specific hardware requirements.  Apache (with mod_perl) and
MySQL both take up a lot of RAM; running a complete system with 128MB
might be possible, if you do some tuning of the configuration, but a
practical minimum 256MB is recommended, though less could be sufficient
with some tuning.Storage space depends on how busy you expect the site
to be; 250MB is possible, but a minimum 1GB is recommended.  Necessary
processor speed is also dependent on how busy the site is; Pentium 133
or equivalent might work, but less than a Pentium II/200 is not
recommended.</P>
<P>For the curious, Slashdot (as of September 2001) runs on nine machines:
nine webservers (each is Pentium III/600, 1GB RAM, 9GB hard drive), one
NFS server (600MHz PIII, 1GB RAM), and three database servers
database server (quad 600MHz PIII, 4GB RAM).  One database server is
live, one is a replicated backup, and a third is for doing live searches
and performance-intensive SELECTs by daemons etc.</P>
<P>However, this is certainly overkill for most sites (and possibly even
overkill for Slashdot).  slashcode.com runs on two web servers and one
NFS/database server.  Many sites can run fine on just one machine for
everything (we use a minimum of two web server machines on every site
for load balancing and redundancy).</P>

<H1><A NAME="versions">VERSIONS</A></H1>
<P>Each version of slash has a code name, and the files on CVS for that
version are tagged with that name.  The current release is always
MAIN.  The versioning scheme is as Linux and Perl are,
revision.version.subversion.  version is even for releases, and odd
for development.  The codename applies to the development version
and subsequent release.</P>
<P>For example, 1.0.11 is a normal release, while 1.1.0 is the first
development release for what will be the next release (either 1.2
or 2.0).</P>
<P>The CVS repository is tagged with version numbers, so to get release
1.0.3, use tag "v1_0_3_0".  The last number (in this case a zero) will
be incremented during development ("v1_0_3_1", "v1_0_3_2", etc.) until
the next release.</P>
