=head1 NAME

README - Slash Readme


=head1 WARNING

This release of Slash is PRERELEASE software.  Run at your own risk. There
may be bugs, and documentation is not yet finished or wrong.  We feel this
release is stable for production use, as we use it on http://slashcode.com/,
but it may have more problems than one would expect from a final release.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Slash -- Slashdot Like Automated Storytelling Homepage -- is the code
that runs Slashdot.  More than that, however, Slash is an architecture
for putting together web sites.  It comes with functionality for posting
articles, conducting polls, having discussions, and more.  But it can be
extended in innumerable ways.

Slash is written in Perl, and is built on top of Apache and mod_perl. It
requires a database backend, though the only well-supported database
used with it is MySQL (more databases will become well-supported as time
goes on; PostgreSQL support is already well on its way).  Slash is
fast, scalable, and secure (as evidenced by one of the best test cases
you could have, running Slashdot itself).

Through a plugin system, developers can add functionality to Slash. 
Through themes and templates (which are written using Template Toolkit),
the look and feel of a Slash site can be customized.

See F<INSTALL> for information about installing Slash, including hardware
and software requirements.  Read that document carefully, and follow the
instructions as precisely as possible.

Also see F<INSTALL> for information on upgrading from previous versions
of Slash.

As noted in the FAQ, please send any bug reports, and subscribe to
mailing lists, at Slash's SourceForge site.

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

The F<.pod> documentation included with Slash can be read with the
C<perldoc> program, included with perl, or translated using one of
the many C<pod2*> translators.

The documentation is also available online on the Slash FAQ.
