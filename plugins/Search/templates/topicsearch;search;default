Displays multi-topics portion of the search form.
Form field names should be of the form "topic_<tid>".


Wrong!  Form elements can have arrays, this is all a big broken
hack that I suspected never worked in the first place. The code
in Search.pm was pretty obviously never tested for this. None
of the sites that we maintain use this template, someone needs to fix it.
I looked at the foundries (which I do believe uses this) it is not working there
either.

	* selected_topics = List of selected topics in hashref form, (ie, 
		a topic is selected if $selected_topic{$topic} is non-zero)

	* topics = List of topics to choose from. Each element is:
		* name = topic name
		* tid = topic id#
