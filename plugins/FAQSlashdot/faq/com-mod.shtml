<h2>
What's up with flat/threaded/nested comments?</h2>
These are just different ways of displaying what can be a rather long list
of comments. Here's the rundown:
<ul>
<li>
Flat mode displays all the comments in one gigantic list, without showing
anything in the way of relationships between comments.</li>

<p><a href="http://images.slashdot.org/faq/screen_flat.gif"><img SRC="http://images.slashdot.org/faq/scaled_screen_flat.gif" ALT="Flat Mode" width=245 height=198></a>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Threaded shows a hierarchy of responses, with replies as links to new pages.</li>

<p><a href="http://images.slashdot.org/faq/screen_threaded.gif"><img SRC="http://images.slashdot.org/faq/scaled_screen_threaded.gif" ALT="Threaded Mode" width=245 height=109></a>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Nested displays the same hierarchy of responses, but displays all of the
comments. (This can be a bitch of a page to render on weaker platforms
and in longer discussions.)</li>

<h2>
Will you delete my comment?</h2>
No.  We believe that discussions in Slashdot are like discussions in real 
life- you can't change what you say, you only can attempt to clarify by 
saying more.  In other words, you can't delete a comment that you've
posted, you only can post a reply to yourself and attempt to clarify
what you've said.<p>
In short, you should think twice before you click that 'Save' button because 
once you hit it, we aren't going to let you Undo it.

<h2>
Why did my comment get deleted?</h2>
The only time we ever delete comments is if the comment contains malformed
HTML that is somehow causing Slashdot to fail to display properly. Comments
are not deleted on the basis of content. At this point, however, it shouldn't
be a big worry. The comment engine is reasonably bulletproof, and it's
pretty tough to post a comment that breaks Netscape.
<p>If you posted a comment and you don't see it now, it may have been moderated
down below your threshold (see <a href="com-mod.shtml#cm600">below</a>).
If you set your threshold to -1, you should be able to see it again.

<h2>
Why did it take so long for my comment to appear?</h2>
If the system told you that your comment got submitted, it'll show up.
Because of the way data gets cached in our system, it could take as much
as ten or fifteen minutes (although it doesn't usually take that long).

<h2>
What's up with "First Post" comments?</h2>
"First Post" comments are one of those odd little memetic hiccups that
come out of nowhere and run amok. Basically, people with altogether far
too much spare time sit and reload Slashdot, hoping that they will get
the "First Post" in a discussion. This is one of those things that the
moderation system was designed to clean up, and for the most part, it works.
"First Post" comments usually get moderated down as off-topic almost instantly.

<h2>
It seems like the quality of comment posts is declining. Are you doing
anything about it?</h2>
We have a moderation system.
<p>One of the unfortunate side-effects of the increasing popularity of
Slashdot is that the number of trolls, flame-warriors and all-around lamers
increases as well, and it only takes a relatively small number of them
to make a lot of noise. Keeping this noise to a minimum is one of the primary
goals of the moderation system (which is explained in detail <a href="com-mod.shtml#cm600">elsewhere</a>
in this FAQ).
<p>Since this system is essentially an experiment in trying to solve the
problems inherent in mass communication, one would expect its success to
be variable, and indeed, this is the case. Some days it works great, and
some days it doesn't.

<h2>
Moderation seems restrictive. Is it really necessary?</h2>
In short, yes.
<p>As you might have noticed, Slashdot gets a lot of comments. Thousands
a day. Tens of thousands a month. At any given time, the database holds
50,000+ comments. A single story might have a thousand replies- and let's
be realistic: Not all of the comments are that great. In fact, some are
down right terrible, but others are truly gems.
<p>The moderation system is designed to sort the gems and the crap from
the steady stream of information that flows through the pipe. And wherever
possible, it tries to make the readers of the site take on the responsibility.
<p>The goal is that each reader will be able to <a href="com-mod.shtml#cm610">read
Slashdot at a level that they find appropriate</a>. The impatient can read
nothing at all but the original stories. Some will only want to read the
highest rated of comments, some will want to eliminate anonymous posts,
and others will want to read every last drip of data, from the First Posts!
to the spam. The system we've created here will make that happen. Or at
least, it sure will try...
<p><b>Goals</b>
<ul>
<li>
1.Promote quality, discourage crap.</li>

<li>
2.Make Slashdot as readable as possible for as many people as possible.</li>

<li>
3.Do not require a huge amount of time from any single moderator.</li>

<li>
4.Do not allow a single moderator a "reign of terror."</li>
</ul>
On the whole, we think the moderation system works really well, but often
people disagree. Their disagreement usually stems from different expectations.
They see a bunch of moderations countering each other. They see a comment
moderated blatantly wrong. A 'Troll' flagged 'Off topic' (or vice versa)
and feel that the system is flawed.
<p>Of course it is flawed! It's built upon the efforts of diverse human
beings volunteering their time to help! Some humans are selfish and destructive.
Others work hard and fair. It's my opinion that the sum of all their efforts
is pretty damn good.
<p>Read Slashdot at a threshold of 3 and behold the quality of the comments
you read. Certainly you aren't reading a wild and freewheeling discussion
anymore, but you <i>are</i> reading many valid points from many intelligent
people. I am actually pretty amazed.

Most of the trolls and useless stuff comes from "Anonymous Coward" posters.

We've thought about it. We think the ability to post anonymously is important.
Sometimes people have important information they want to post, but are
afraid to do it if they can be linked to it. Anonymous Coward posting will
continue to exist for the foreseeable future.

You're reading Slashdot from behind a web proxy that allows connections from any

to be posted from this address until the proxy is better secured. <b>Please notify

<h2>
How did the moderation system develop?</h2>
In order to understand the system, it might help to understand how we got
there. It wasn't random, it was trial and error and progression. I'm constantly
tweaking and changing, trying to squeeze more out. Trying to make a more
efficient, more fair system.
<p><b>Before Moderation</b>
<p>In the beginning, Slashdot was small. We got dozens of posts each day,
and it was good. The signal was high, the noise was low. Moderation was
unnecessary because we were nobody. It was a different world then. Each
day we grew, adding more and more users, and increasing the number of comments
submitted. As this happened, many users discovered new and annoying ways
to abuse the system. The authors had but one option: Delete annoying comments.
But as the system grew, we knew that we would never be able to keep up.
We were outnumbered.
<p><b>Hand Picked Few</b>
<p>So, I picked people to help. Just a few. 25 or so at the end. They were
given the simple ability to add or subtract points to comments. The primary
function of these brave souls was to weed out spam and First Post and flame
bait. Plus, when they found smart stuff, to bring it out.
<p>The system worked pretty well, but as Slashdot continued to grow, it
was obvious that these 25 people wouldn't be enough to keep up with the
thousands of posts we were getting each day. It was obvious that we needed
more.
<p><b>400 Lucky Winners</b>
<p>So we picked more the only way we could. Using the actions of the original
25 moderators, we picked 400 more. We picked the 400 people who had posted
good comments: comments that had been flagged as the cream of Slashdot.
Immediately several dozen of these new moderators had their access revoked
for being abusive, but they settled down.
<p>At this time I began to experiment with ways of restricting the power
of moderators to prevent abuses. 25 people are easy to keep an eye on,
but 400 is another matter. I knew that someday I would have even less control
since I intended to eventually give access to even more people. While moderators
still added and subtracted points, the number of points they were given
dropped from hundreds to dozens.
<p>As time went on, I began working on the next phase: mass moderation.
I learned a lot from having so many moderators. I learned that I needed
to limit the power of each person to prevent a single rogue from spoiling
it for everyone. And then we took the next step.
<p><b>Today: Most Anyone</b>
<p>Today any regular Slashdot reader is probably eligible to become a moderator.
A variety of factors weigh into it, but if you are logged in when you browse
Slashdot comments, you might occasionally be granted moderator access.
Don't worry about it. Just keep reading this document and learn what to
do about it!
<p><b>Who</b>
<p>It's probably the most difficult part of the process: who is allowed
to moderate. On one hand, many people say "Everyone," but I've chosen to
avoid that path because the potential for abuse is so great. Instead, I've
set up a few simple rules for determining who is eligible to moderate.
<ul>
  <li> <b>Logged In User</b> If the system can't keep track, it won't work, so 
    you gotta log in. Sorry if you're paranoid, but this system demands a certain 
    level of accountability.</li>
  <br>
  &nbsp; 
  <li> <b>Regular Slashdot Readers</b> The scripts track average accesses from 
    each logged-in user. It then selects eligible users who read an average number 
    of times. The homepage doesn't count either. It then picks users from the 
    middle of the pack- no obsessive compulsive reloaders, and nobody who just 
    happened to read an article this week.</li>
  <br>
  &nbsp; 
  <li> <b>Long Time Readers</b> The system throws out the newest few thousand 
    accounts. This prevents people from creating new accounts to simply get moderator 
    access, but more importantly, means that newbies will have to be part of the 
    community for a few weeks before they gain access to the controls to a system 
    they don't understand.</li>
  <br>
  &nbsp; 
  <li> <b>Willing to Serve</b> If you don't want to moderate, just visit your 
    user preferences, and set yourself as "Unwilling."</li>
  <br>
  &nbsp; 
  <li> <b>Positive Contributors</b> Slashdot tracks your <a href="com-mod.shtml#cm700">"karma."</a> 
    If you have Positive, Good, or Excellent karma, this means you have posted 
    more good comments than bad, and are eligible to moderate. This weeds out 
    spam accounts.</li>
</ul>
The end result is a pool of eligible users that represent (hopefully) average, 
positive Slashdot contributors. Occasionally (well, every 30 minutes actually), 
the system checks the number of comments that have been posted, and gives a proportionate 
number of eligible users "tokens." When any user acquires a certain number of 
tokens, he or she becomes a moderator. This means that you'll need to be eligible 
for many of these slices in order to actually gain access. It all works to make 
sure that everyone takes turns, and nobody can abuse the system, and that only 
"regular" readers become moderators (as opposed to some random newbie ;)

<h2>
How does moderation work?</h2>
When moderators are given access, they are given a number of points of
influence to play with. Each comment they moderate deducts a point. When
they run out of points, they are done serving until next time it is their
turn.
<p>Moderation takes place by selecting an adjective from a drop down list
that appears next to comments containing descriptive words like "Flamebait"
or "Informative." Bad words will reduce the comment's score by a single
point, and good words increase a comment's score by a single point. All
comments are scored on an absolute scale from -1 to 5. Logged-in users
start at 1 (although this can vary from 0 to 2 based on their <a href="com-mod.shtml#cm700">karma</a>)
and anonymous users start at 0.
<p><a href="com-mod.shtml#cm1800">Moderators can not participate in the
same discussion as both a moderator and a poster</a>. This is to prevent
abuses, and while it is one of the more controversial aspects of the system,
I'm sticking to it. There are enough lurkers that moderate that, if you
want to post, feel free.
<p>Moderation points <a href="com-mod.shtml#cm1200">expire after 3 days</a>
if they are left unused. You then go back into the pool and might someday
be given access again.
<p>Concentrate more on promoting than on demoting. The real goal here is
to find the juicy good stuff and let others read it. Do not promote personal
agendas. Do not let your opinions factor in. Try to be impartial about
this. Simply disagreeing with a comment is not a valid reason to mark it
down. Likewise, agreeing with a comment is not a valid reason to mark it
up. The goal here is to share ideas. To sift through the haystack and find
needles. And to keep the children who like to spam Slashdot in check.

<h2>
Do Editors Moderate?</h2>
The Slashdot Editors have unlimited mod points, and we have no problem
using them.

<p>Our moderations represent about 3% of all moderation,
and according to Meta Moderation, the fairness of these moderations are either
statistically indistinguishable from non-admin users, or substantially better.
The raw numbers are:
95.1% of non-admin upmods are fair, and 94.7% of admin upmods are fair.
79.1% of non-admin downmods are fair, and 83.6% of admin downmods are fair.

<p>The editors tend to find crapfloods and moderate them down: a single
malicious user can post dozens of comments, which would require several
users to moderate them down, but a single admin can take care of it in
seconds.  This tends to remove the obvious garbage from the discussion so
that the general population can use their mod points to determine good.
Otherwise, a few crapfloods could suck a lot of moderator points out of
the system and throw things out of whack.

<P>You can argue that allowing admins unlimited moderation is somehow inherently unfair,
but one of the goals of Slashdot is to produce readable content for a variety
of readers with a variety of reading habits.  I believe this process improves 
discussions for the vast majority of Slashdot Readers, so it will stay this way.

<h2>
What are thresholds?</h2>
Your "threshold" is the minimum score that a comment needs to have if it
is to be displayed to you. Comments are scored from -1 to 5, and you can
set your threshold at any score within that range. So, for example, if
you set your threshold at 2, only comments with scores of 2 or above would
be displayed. Setting your threshold at -1 will display all comments. 0
is almost all comments. 1 filters out most Anonymous Cowards, and so on.
Higher threshold settings reduce the number of comments you see, but (in
theory, anyway) the quality of the posts you do see increases.

<h2>
What is karma?</h2>
Your karma is a reference that primarily represents how your comments have been 
moderated in the past. Karma is structured on the following scale &quot;Terrible, 
Bad, Neutral, Positive, Good, and Excellent.&quot; If a comment you post is moderated 
up, your karma will rise. Consequently, if you post a comment that has been moderated 
down, your karma will fall. 
<p>In addition to moderation, other things factor into karma as well. You
can get some karma by <a href="editorial.shtml#ed100">submitting a story
</a>that
we decide to post. Also, <a href="metamod.shtml">metamoderation</a> can
cause your karma to change. This encourages good moderators, and ideally
removes moderator access from bad ones.

<h2>
It seems unfair that I can't get any more karma than that even if I earn
it.</h2>
Karma is used to remove risky users from the moderator pool, and to assign
a bonus point to users who have contributed positively to Slashdot in the
past. It is not your IQ, dick length/cup size, value as a human being,
or a score in a video game. It does not determine your worth as a Slashdot
reader. It does not cure cancer or grant you a seat on the secret spaceship
that will be traveling to Mars when the Krulls return to destroy the planet
in 2012. Karma fluctuates dramatically as users post, moderate, and meta-moderate.
Don't let it bother you. It's just a number in the database.

<h2>
Why didn't I get karma for a Quickie or a Slashback story?</h2>
This is a shortcoming in the code that we haven't solved yet. Essentially, the 
system can easily track a submitter of a story and grant them karma, but Quickies 
and Slashback each operate differently. A dozen or more people might contribute 
directly to any one of those stories. The system doesn't really have any internal 
record to handle sorting out the karma distribution. Besides that, we currently 
grant karma points for an accepted homepage story.

<h2>
What is karma good for?</h2>
Karma is used to determine who moderates and who doesn't. Extremely bad
karma usually indicates a user account that is being used to spam the discussion
board.
<p>Secondly, users with better karma are given a bonus point which can sometimes 
  increase your <a href="com-mod.shtml#cm703">karma level</a>. Logged-in users normally post comments with a score 
  of 1, but the theory is that if a user earns higher karma, they may post with 
  a score of 2. Essentially its a reward for being a good participant on Slashdot, 
  or a punishment for being a bad one. Users with very low karma might lose the 
  +1 associated with being a logged-in user. Extremely bad users might even be 
  penalized to a -1.

If you've been moderating or posting, your karma will likely fluctuate

Whenever I use my +1 Bonus, I get moderated down and lose Karma!</h2>
As a good poster, you earned a bonus: you are allowed to speak slightly "louder" 
then other people. In most cases, this is because you've earned it. But with that 
right comes a responsibility - you have to justify that bonus score. The louder 
you speak, the more likely you are to be moderated down, unless you're sufficiently 
interesting to prompt the moderators to let you keep your bonus score. This is 
how the system is designed to work: you can't just rack up karma, and then post 
nonsense.

I just got moderator access. What do I do?</h2>
Moderate! Read comments (preferably at a low threshold) and when you see
comments that are very insightful, or perhaps just plain off topic, select
that option from the drop down list. When you are done, hit the 'Moderate'
button. That's it!

<h2>
Why can't I moderate any more?</h2>
You either used up your moderator points, or they expired. Moderation is
like jury duty. You never know when you're gonna have to do it, and when
you get it, you only do it for a little bit. Once those points are gone,
you're done.

<h2>
Why don't you give moderators unlimited moderator access to 5 stories instead
of giving them just 5 points?</h2>
It's a good question. Moderators' primary complaint is that they are often
crippled by the tiny amount of points they have, and the overwhelming amount
of comments that need moderation. If a good moderator could moderate all
the comments in a given story, certainly that would be a great improvement.
<p>The problem is that a single bad moderator could wreak havoc across
those same 5 stories. By limiting the number of moderation points to 5,
any single moderator can only do so much damage. Sure they can only do
so much *good* too, but that's the trade-off. I'd rather see a hundred
comments unmoderated then see a hundred comments moderated badly by some
jerk with an axe to grind.

<h2>
I found a comment that was unfairly moderated!</h2>
Most of the time we've found that, for every moderator out there pushing
an agenda, there are a dozen good moderators making sure that everyone
is getting a fair say. However, to the extent that there may be problems
with unfair moderation, we have come up with a system of <a href="metamod.shtml">meta-moderation</a>
(moderating the moderation) to address this.

<h2>
What about separating the rating (+1,-1) from the qualifier (off-topic,
informative)? Often a post may be flamebait, but of excellent quality nevertheless.</h2>
While this may be true in some cases, its limited applicability doesn't
justify complicating the moderators' user interface. Also, there's too
much potential for abuse.

<h2>
Is this censorship?</h2>
I don't think so. Nothing is deleted: if you want to read the raw, uncut
Slashdot, simply set your threshold to -1 and go crazy! This system is
simply a method for us to try to work together to categorize the thousands
of comments that are posted each day in such a way that we can benefit
from the wisdom contained in the discussions. It's in there! It just takes
some work to find it.

This is a bug that followed us around for some time, but we're pretty sure
it's fixed. If you happen upon a comment that is moderated outside the
allowed -1 to 5 range, please let <a href="mailto:cliff@slashdot.org">Cliff</a>

<h2>
What is a good comment? A bad comment?</h2>
A good comment says something interesting or insightful. It has a link
to a relevant piece of information that will add something to the discussion.
It might not be Shakespeare, but it's not Beavis and Butthead. It's not
off topic or flamey. It doesn't call someone names. It doesn't personally
attack someone because of a disagreement of opinion.
<p>Some of my favorite "bad" or off-topic comments are things like "Slashdot
sucks!" and "This isn't news for nerds!" and "Moderate this XXX!" Any of
these may be true, but they're probably off topic!

<h2>
3 days is not enough time to moderate!</h2>
I disagree. The 3 day limit exists to help push the system along. If users
were allowed to hang on to their points, they could save them for a discussion
within which they wanted to push an agenda. It's all right if points go
unused- points are free, and there are always hundreds of users with more
points who can fill in.

<h2>
If I Post in a Discussion I moderated, Why Don't I get My Points Back?</h2>
This is intentional. If you could retrieve your points, you could abuse
the system very easily. Here is an example:
<ol>
<li>
Naughty Bob moderates 5 comments in a discussion. He uses up his points.</li>

<li>
Naughty Bob waits 2 days, and then posts a message to that discussion.</li>

<li>
Naughty Bob gets his 5 moderator points back!</li>

<li>
GOTO 1</li>
</ol>
If Naughty Bob was out pushing an agenda, he could keep his 5 points indefinitely,
saving them to push discussions around. By taking his points away, he is
unable to do that. Now Naughty Bob has to wait until the next time he gets
points.

<h2>
How can I improve my karma?</h2>
What follows was originally a story submission by <a href="mailto:dkh2@po.cwru.edu">dkh2</a>.
It seemed to me that it would better serve readers here:
<p><b>10 Tips for Improving Your Karma:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Post Intelligently:</b> Interesting, insightful, thought provoking comments
are rated higher on a fairly consistent basis.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Post Calmly:</b> Nobody likes a flame war. In fact, more times than
not the flamer gets burned much more than their target."Flame Bait" is
hit quickly and consistently with "-1" by moderators. As the bumper sticker
says... "Don't be a dick."</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>If You Can't Be Deep, Be Funny:</b> If you don't have something truly
developing to the topic, some humor is welcome. Humor is lacking in our
lives and will continue to be promoted. Remember though, what rips your
sides out may be completely inane to somebody else.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Post Early:</b> If an article has over a certain number of posts on
it already, yours is less likely to be moderated. This is less likely both
statistically (there are more to choose from) and due to positioning (as
a moderator I have to actually find your post waaay at the end of a long
list.)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Post Often:</b> If you only post once a month you can expect your karma
to remain low. Also, lively discussion in an open forum is what makes Slashdot
really "Rock the Casbah."</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Stay On Topic:</b> Off topic posts are slapped quickly and consistently
with "-1" by moderators.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Be Original:</b> Avoid being redundant and just repeating what has already
been said. <i>Smirk.</i> Yes, being moderated as "redundant" is worth "-1"
to your post and your karma. Especially to be avoided are the "what he
said" and "me too" posts.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Read It Before You Post:</b> Does it say what you really want it to
say? Check your own spelling and grammar. Occasionally, a perfectly beneficial
post is passed over by moderators because of this completely irrelevant-to-content
feature. This is also a good approach to checking yourself for what you're
really saying. Can't tell you the number of times I've stopped myself from
saying the opposite of what I meant by checking my own spelling and grammar.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Log In As a Registered User:</b> I know, this sounds obvious but, "Anonymous
Coward" does not have a karma rating. You can't reap the perceived benefits
of your own accidental brilliance if you post anonymously. Have pride in
your work and take credit for it.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Read Slashdot Regularly:</b> You can't possibly contribute to the discussion
if you're not in the room. Come to the party and play.</li>

<h2>
Lots of early posts that "seem" to be informative/insightful and get mod-ed
up when they really shouldn't be. If the author sounds confident, people
seem to just give him points. By the time an actual informative post makes
it in, it's too late to go back. How could you accommodate this in the
moderation system?</h2>
Moderators are human beings, and human beings make mistakes. Still, moderators
should try to be as thorough as they can. If there's a link in the comment,
moderators should check it. If there are facts in the comment that a moderator
knows to be wrong, he or she should take that into account. If the moderator
doesn't know if the facts in a comment are correct or not, maybe the moderator
should skip that comment.

<h2>
What sorts of anti-troll filters exist?</h2>
A handful of filters have been put into place to try to make sure that
people don't abuse the system. The most important is that the same person
can't post more than once every 120 seconds.
Also, if a single user is moderated down several times in a short time
frame, a temporary ban will be imposed on that user... a cooling off period
if you will. It lasts for 72 hours, or more for users who have posted a ton.
<p>The <i>vast</i> majority of you will never encounter any of these troll
filters. If you do encounter one unfairly, let us know so we can fix it.
This stuff is fairly beta code, so there are bound to be problems.

If someone copies text from elsewhere and doesn't mention that it's
copied or name the source, it's plagiarism. Moderate it Redundant, or
feel free to alert moderators by posting a link (perhaps anonymously).

Why can't you? What are you talking about, you can! Go to the <a href="http://slashdot.org">front

You can search for anything you'd like in the Slashdot database, stories,
comments, users, polls, and even journal entries. Filtering is a little
tricky, you can filter <i>for</i> authors, topics, or sections, but not
filter <i>out</i> authors, topics, or sections. Occasionally our search
feature gets bogged down when many users are accessing it. In this case
we recommend using <a href="http://google.com">google</a>. Google likes
to cache Slashdot stories and is reasonably accurate.

<h2>
What are post modes?</h2>
Comment posting modes are not related to <a href="#cm100">comment viewing modes</a>.
Instead, they determine how the text that you enter for a comment is interpreted
and thus how it will be displayed to the reader.  There are four post modes:
<UL>
<LI><B>HTML Formatted</B>: You determine the formatting, using allowed HTML
tags and entities.</LI>
<LI><B>Plain Old Text</B>: Same as "HTML Formatted", except that &lt;BR&gt;
is automatically inserted for newlines, and other whitespace is converted
to non-breaking spaces in a more-or-less intelligent way.</LI>
<LI><B>Extrans</B>: Same as "Plain Old Text", except that &amp; and &lt;
and &gt; are converted to entities (no HTML markup allowed).</LI>
<LI><B>Code</B>: Same as "Extrans", but a monospace font is used, and a
best attempt is made at performing proper indentation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In addition, there is an extra "tag" you can use called <TT>ECODE</TT>.
This functions like the "Code" post mode, but may be inlined in "HTML
Formatted" and "Plain Old Text" posts, and the entire block is indented.
(Getting really fancy: if you wish to use the text <TT>&lt;/ECODE&gt;</TT> inside the
<TT>ECODE</TT> tag, you may instead use <TT>&lt;ECODE
END="SOMETAG"&gt;...&lt;/SOMETAG&gt;</TT> instead of
<TT>&lt;ECODE&gt;...&lt;/ECODE&gt;</TT>.)</P>
<P>You may set your default post mode on the
<A href="http://slashdot.org/users.pl?op=editcomm">Comments preferences</A>
page.

<h2> A comment I posted shows a different score on my user page than in the <br>
  comments page.</h2>
Your user page displays the comments' "Natural" score.  That is the base
score that all users share for any given comment.  This number includes
things like moderations up and down, default posting bonus, and so forth.
However, that same comment, when displayed in the context of a discussion,
reflects the bonuses or penalties associated with any number of user
preferences.  These options are
<A href="http://slashdot.org/users.pl?op=editcomm">all configurable</A>, and
include settings like the small comment penalty, the long comment bonus,
and any reason modifiers you may have defined.

<h2>What do the choices in the moderation drop-down boxes mean?</h2>
<ul>

<li><b>Normal</b> -- This is the default setting attached to every comment when
you have moderation privileges. Normally, you should not need to actually
select this option, but if your mouse slips and you accidentally moderate up or
down a comment you didn't mean to, you can undo that mistake by choosing Normal
before you hit the "Moderate" button.

<li><b>Offtopic</b> -- A comment which has nothing to do with the story it's
linked to (song lyrics, obscene ascii art, comments about another topic
entirely) is Offtopic.

<li><b>Flamebait</b> -- Flamebait refers to comments whose sole purpose is to
insult and enrage. If someone is not-so-subtly picking a fight (racial insults
are a dead giveaway), it's Flamebait.

<li><b>Troll</b> -- A Troll is similar to Flamebait, but slightly more refined.
This is a prank comment intended to provoke indignant (or just confused)
responses.  A Troll might mix up vital facts or otherwise distort reality, to
make other readers react with helpful "corrections." Trolling is the online
equivalent of intentionally dialing wrong numbers just to waste other people's
time.

<li><b>Redundant</b> -- Redundant posts are ones which add no new information,
but instead take up space with repeating information either in the Slashdot
post, the attached links, or lots of previous comments. For instance, some
posters cut and paste otherwise legitimate comments in multiple places in the
same discussion; the pasted versions are Redundant.

<li><b>Insightful</b> -- An Insightful statement makes you think, puts a new
spin on a given story (or aspect of a story). An analogy you hadn't thought of,
or a telling counterexample, are examples of Insightful comments.

<li><b>Interesting</b> -- If you believe a comment to be Interesting (and it's
not mostly Redundant, Offtopic, or otherwise lame), it is.

<li><b>Informative</b> -- Often comments add new information to explain the
circumstances hinted at by a particular story, fill in "The Other Side" of an
argument, provide specifications to a product described too vaguely elsewhere,
etc. Such comments are Informative.

<li><b>Funny</b> -- Think of Funny as being a good moderation choice if you
actually think the comment <i>is</i> funny, not just because it seems intended
to be.  Not every knock-knock joke is Funny.

<li><b>Overrated</b> -- Sometimes you'll run into a comment which for whatever
reason has been moderated out of proportion -- this probably means several
moderators saw it at nearly the same time, thought it was Funny, Insightful
etc, and their scores added together exaggerate its relative merit. (A
knock-knock joke at +5, Funny) Such a comment is Overrated.  It's not knocking
the original poster to say so, but it's probably better to spend your mod
points on comments which are deserving of being moderated up.

<li><b>Underrated</b> -- Likewise, some comments get smashed lower than they
perhaps deserve by overzealous moderators. If you moderate a comment as
Underrated, you're saying that it deserves to be read by more people than will
see it at its current score. As with Overrated, if you can think of a more
specific moderation reason, do so -- if a comment has already been moderated
with an appropriate label though, and you just want to indicate that it
deserves greater visibility, that's what Underrated is for.  However, if a
comment is labeled with a fitting (negative) label, choosing Underrated isn't
such a great idea, because you could end up with contradictions like "+5,
Flamebait."
