<h2>What is this crazy tags thing?</h2>
<p> Slashdot is currently experimenting with tagging articles.  You are
encouraged to use this feature to submit a handful of tags: brief labels
that you think best describe this article.  You might choose to say that
this is an article about 'security' and 'mozilla'.
</p>

<p>This is all very beta. Currently tagging is <b>only open to
subscribers and some users.</b></p>

<p>We don't know exactly how this will all work, and a lot of it really
depends on you.  If you choose to add your own tags, be aware:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your tags are <b>public</b>. Everyone will be able to see them!</li>
<li>Keep your tags brief.</li>
<li>Tags are space-separated. Use "bigbrother", not "big brother".
<li>We provide a few example tags for you. Use them if you like.</li>
<li>Don't forget to click 'Tag' to save your tags.</li>
<li>Tags must be all-lowercase, no punctuation. Numbers can  
appear but can't be first. Smoosh them up: for "Web 2.0", tag  
"web20". Max 64 chars.</li>
<li>Don't use plurals.  It's "harddrive", not "harddrives".</li>
<li>For the opposite of a tag, prefix it with "!", e.g.  "!funny"
means unfunny.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're excited about this, and see huge potential for this system.
From user feedback on articles, to comment moderation, the system is
really limited only by your participation, and our database hardware!

<h2>Are tags objective or subjective? Can I use any tag I want?</h2>

<p>Other tagging systems let users make up any tags they want, and
punt on the issue of objective meaning. So the tag "foo" means for each
user whatever they want it to mean, and to the system it means nothing
at all, it's just an identifier.</p>

<p>We're going to build the next generation of moderation on top of
tags. That means we're going to poach your namespace. Some tags will
have a substantive effect on the system right from the start (or very
soon). Our article tagger will know about tags like "dupe" or "typo".
When we roll out tagging on comments, we will teach it "troll" and
"informative". These tags can have a meaning in the system. And when
<em>you</em> come up with ways of using tags that <em>we</em>
haven't anticipated, we will bring them into the system.</p>

<p>But your tags do not belong to you, they belong to everyone.
We reserve the right to make changes that we think are necessary.
Since this system is totally experimental, we don't know exactly what all
of this might mean: it could mean one day we consolidate and change all
"canine" to "dog" tags.  It could mean we define some system tag and usurp
another tag. This is the nature of a system in active development. Don't
say we didn't warn you!</p>

<p>Tags elsewhere are your own personal playground and nobody cares if
you mess around. On Slashdot, abusive uses of tags could have negative
consequences. Precisely what that means, we don't know yet.</p>

<p>Yes, that's pretty arbitrary. We'll spell out policy as this evolves.
For now, the deal is: tag in good faith, and if there's abuse, we'll
deal with it in good faith.</p>
