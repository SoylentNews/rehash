NAME
    INSTALL - Slash Installation

SYNOPSIS
    This document describes how to install Slash 1.1.x / 2.0.x (code-named
    "bender"). For instructions on installation of previous versions of
    Slash, see the INSTALL document included with those distributions.

    These instructions have only been tested on Linux. Installation under
    BSD and other Unix OSes should work similarly. We've had reports of the
    1.0.x version of Slash running on Windows, but have done no testing and
    have no further information.

    PostgreSQL support in Slash 1.1.x is currently alpha-quality, while
    MySQL support is beta-quality.

    Slash can always be downloaded from SourceForge, and from the Slashdot
    FTP site.

            http://sourceforge.net/projects/slashcode/
            ftp://ftp.slashdot.org//pub/slash/

    The CVS repository (http://cvs.slashcode.com/) is tagged with version
    numbers, so to get release 1.0.3, use tag "v1_0_3_0". The last number
    (in this case a zero) will be incremented during development
    ("v1_0_3_1", "v1_0_3_2", etc.) until the next release.

    The software and hardware requirements are listed at the end of the
    document, because we know you want to get right into the installation.

INSTALLATION
  Installation Notes

    *   For slashd (see utils/slash, which starts slashd), mod_perl (see
        httpd/httpd.conf), and MySQL, we set all processes to run in GMT.
        Then it is easy to convert dates to whatever the user's local time
        is. If you have date offset problems, check that all of these are
        properly set to run in GMT.

    *   You cannot have different versions of the Slash modules installed
        for different sites on the same Apache server. Well, if you want to,
        you can try the Apache::PerlVINC module, but this is not recommended
        for performance reasons. Slash is designed to have one shared core
        of code for all Slash sites on a system. (This is made easier than
        it was in 1.0.x, where to customize a site, you needed to change the
        module code; this should no longer be necessary.)

    *   All of the installation steps below should be executed as root.

  Installation Procedure

    There are six steps to installation. Skip the parts you already have
    installed (making sure you have the correct versions). Make sure to read
    the special note about Apache / mod_perl installation.

    1.  Install MySQL.

        Please refer to MySQL documentation for compilation and/or
        installation notes for any questions with this process. Find the
        script that runs mysql (probably safe_mysqld) and add these lines to
        the beginning of it:

                TZ=GMT
                export TZ

        Create a database to be used by Slash.

        Create a username/password that can access that database (by
        default, we normally set the user to have all permissions, but that
        might not be appropriate for your site).

    2.  Install perl.

        perl is likely already installed on your machine; make sure its
        version is 5.005_03 or better.

    3.  Install Apache and mod_perl.

        You MUST install mod_perl and Apache as directed here. OK, that is
        not strictly true, but it is *mostly* true. If you already have
        mod_perl installed, it is probably not configured properly to work
        with Slash and you will have to rebuild it. [If you are using the
        provided httpd.conf file from the slash distribution, and find that
        Apache is giving you errors, chances are mod_perl is not installed
        correctly, and you need to build it from scratch.] Of course, if you
        have your own Apache modules or build options, you will need to
        modify the instructions here appropriately.

        First, untar apache and mod_perl. Then, go to the mod_perl
        directory, and have mod_perl build and install apache for you:

                perl Makefile.PL APACHE_SRC=/where_you_have_the_source DO_HTTPD=1 \
                        USE_APACI=1 PERL_MARK_WHERE=1 EVERYTHING=1 \
                        APACHE_PREFIX=/where_apache_will_be_installed
                make
                make test
                make install

    4.  Install the Perl modules.

        The best way to do this is with the CPAN module.

        With older versions of the CPAN module, the module will try to
        download and install the latest version of Perl. Watch what the
        module is doing; if it begins to download an entire perl
        distribution, hit ctrl-C until it stops, then try again with the
        CPAN module. (Hopefully, the new CPAN module will have been
        installed by this point in the process. If not, try installing the
        latest CPAN module by hand, and then repeat the process.)

        Sometimes, you will be installing a newer version of a module that
        exists elsewhere on the system. You might want to tell the CPAN
        module to automatically remove older files. To do that from the CPAN
        shell, type:

                cpan> o conf make_install_arg UNINST=1

        You might also wish to install each module by hand, using
        distributions found on the CPAN. See
        http://perldoc.com/m?perlmodinstall for more information on
        installing perl modules.

        Note: You must have certain libraries existing on your system before
        building, for Compress::Zlib and XML::Parser. See the section on
        "perl".

        To use the CPAN module, invoke the CPAN shell:

                perl -MCPAN -e shell

        After it has been configured, install Bundle::Slash:

                cpan> install Bundle::Slash

        When Bundle::Slash is finished, install the DBIx::Password module:

                cpan> install DBIx::Password

        When asked, give the info for accessing the Slash database created
        in step 1.

        Feel free to re-run "install Bundle::Slash" if you get errors, or
        just aren't sure what's been installed, etc. It will safely skip
        anything already installed.

        Note: If running BSD, also install the BSD::Resource module.

    5.  Install Slash.

        Unpack the distribution and go to the new directory that creates,
        and type:

                make
                make install

        Note: this depends on a relatively new version of the install
        program that comes with GNU fileutils distribution. Version 4.0 is
        recommended. Some older versions of SuSE, for example, come with
        version 3; just install the latest fileutils package, or version 4.0
        of install.

        There are a few options to "make" and "make install" you may want to
        change.

                option          default                 purpose
                ==========================================================
                SLASH_PREFIX    /usr/local/slash        Location for
                                                        installed files
                INIT            /etc or /etc/rc.d       Location for init
                                                        scripts
                USER            nobody                  User to own files
                GROUP           nobody                  Group to own files

        (USER and GROUP will also be changed later on a per-site basis, in
        step 6. while running install-slashsite.)

        So, for example, you might type (although the default SLASH_PREFIX
        is _strongly_ recommended):

                make SLASH_PREFIX=/home/slash
                make install SLASH_PREFIX=/home/slash

        When done, a configuration file for Apache will be created at
        $SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf. You can put its contents into your
        httpd.conf, or you can just "Include" it in your httpd.conf.

        WARNING!

        Please be aware that if you include $SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf or
        $SLASH_PREFIX/sites/sitename/sitename.conf more than once, or if
        this file shares contents with directives in httpd.conf, that your
        Slash site WILL break. The directives in $SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf
        should be run only ONCE in any any site context.

    6.  Install your Slash site.

        Go to your installation directory (by default, /usr/local/slash) and
        execute (where "VIRTUAL_USER" is the name of the virtual user given
        in the DBIx::Password distribution):

                bin/install-slashsite VIRTUAL_USER

        The program will prompt for answers to several configuration
        questions. Answer the questions. When done, another configuration
        file will be created at $SLASH_PREFIX/$SITENAME/$SITENAME.conf. You
        can put its contents unto your httpd.conf, or you can just "Include"
        it in your httpd.conf.

INSTALLATION OPTIONS
  Multiple Servers

    You can, of course, have a separate database server from your Slash
    server. Further, you can have multiple web servers for one Slash site.
    Slashdot, for instance, has one primary server with all of the code
    (Apache, perl, etc.), and it runs slashd and NFS. Each web server then
    mounts the code read-only over NFS. Some notes:

    *   Make sure the MySQL server allows the user to log in from each web
        server, and the NFS server.

    *   Make sure, if you use the same httpd tree on all machines, that the
        httpd.conf is listening to the proper IP addresses. This can be done
        by putting all of the IP addresses in the conf file, or by having a
        separate Listen file on each machine. Similarly, make sure that each
        web server's logfiles unique to each machine, not written to the NFS
        volumes.

  Virtual Hosts

    Slash has support for virtual hosts, so you can have multiple Slash
    sites on one machine. Simply execute step 6 in the install process for
    each Slash site (after adding a new virtual user to DBIx::Password for
    each).

  SSL

    In Slash, there are two variables for the root URL of the site.
    absolutedir is the full URL, including protocol, while rootdir is the
    URL without protocol:

            absolutedir     http://slashcode.com
            rootdir         //slashcode.com

    absolutedir is used only for creating external links to the site (such
    as in RSS files). rootdir is used for internal links; that way, you can
    use the same HTML pages for SSL and non-SSL. You don't have to do
    anything special to the code or preferences to allow it to work with SSL
    by itself, SSL and non-SSL together, or non-SSL by itself.

  Non-Root

    It is possible to install and run everything here without root.

    Describing the process for a non-root install would take up significant
    space and time, having to account for differences in various systems,
    and all the workarounds necessary for it to work.

    If you must have a non-root install, consult the various documentation
    for Apache, MySQL, and perl about running and installing without root
    access. Then, for Slash, you simply need to set the make variables
    PREFIX, SLASH_PREFIX, and INIT appropriately for your needs.

    Note: Slash (or, more accurately, Apache + mod_perl and MySQL) take up a
    lot of system resources. It is *not advisable* for anyone to run Slash
    at all on a system, without the permission of the administrator of that
    system.

REQUIREMENTS
  Software

    Below, the main software components needed are listed. The recommended
    version is noted, along with the earliest version that has been tested
    (or is expected) to work. The earliest versions are not necessarily
    supported, but should work. perl 5.005_03 is supported, but MySQL 3.22
    is not.

    perl
        Version 5.6.0 (5.005_03).

                http://www.cpan.org/

    MySQL
        Version 3.23 (3.22).

                http://www.mysql.com/

    Apache
        Version 1.3.19 (1.3.6).

                http://httpd.apache.org/

    mod_perl
        Versions 1.25 (1.21).

                http://perl.apache.org/

    Sendmail or other transport daemon
        Refer to your OS distribution.

    Perl module distributions
        See http://search.cpan.org/ and http://www.cpan.org/ to get each
        module individually; however, we recommend you download them using
        the CPAN module.

        The latest version of each module is recommended.

        For Compress::Zlib, the zlib development library is required. For
        XML::Parser, the expat library is required. If they are not present
        on the system already, download and install them before installing
        the modules.

                ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/zlib/
                http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

        The following modules are all included in the Bundle::Slash
        distribution.

        DBI
        Data-ShowTable
        TimeDate
        Msql-Mysql-modules
        ApacheDBI
        Apache-DBILogConfig
        Apache-DBILogger
        libnet
        HTML-Parser
        XML-Parser
        XML-RSS
        MIME-Base64
        Digest-MD5
        URI
        libwww-perl
        DateManip
        File-Spec
        Mail-Sendmail
        Compress-Zlib
        Image-Size
        Storable
        Template

        Also required:
        DBIx-Password

  Hardware

    There are no specific hardware requirements. Apache (with mod_perl) and
    MySQL both take up a lot of RAM; running a complete system with 128MB
    might be possible, if you do some tuning of the configuration, but a
    practical minimum 256MB is recommended, though less could be sufficient
    with some tuning.Storage space depends on how busy you expect the site
    to be; 250MB is possible, but a minimum 1GB is recommended. Necessary
    processor speed is also dependent on how busy the site is; Pentium 133
    or equivalent might work, but less than a Pentium II/200 is not
    recommended.

    For the curious, Slashdot (as of January 2001) runs on eight machines:
    six webservers (each is Pentium III/600, 1GB RAM, 9GB hard drive), one
    NFS server (dual PIII/600, 2GB RAM, 2 x 9GB hard drive), and one
    database server (quad Xeon/550, 2GB RAM, 6 x 9GB hard drive). However,
    this is certainly overkill for most sites (and possibly even overkill
    for Slashdot).

UPGRADING
  Slash 1.0 -> Slash 2.0

    Please read the complete documentation of utils/slash1toslash2. It is a
    program that will convert your database from Slash 1.0 to a new Slash
    2.0 database. The program documentation (which can be read with perldoc)
    details exactly what process it follows to do the conversion, so you can
    attempt to do it by hand if you prefer.
