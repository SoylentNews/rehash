# Note regarding Apache::DBI:
# Slash does not use Apache::DBI (it's just an extra, unnecessary,
# layer of dbh caching).  However, some sites may use it, perhaps for
# other database-backed projects on the same web server.  Apache::DBI
# pushes a PerlCleanupHandler with every created dbh, to roll back
# any open transactions.  The docs for Apache.pm say a handler added
# with push_handlers will be called "before any configured handlers,"
# i.e. before Slash's PerlCleanupHandler, i.e. before the functions below.
# Since createLog and setUser don't leave any transactions open, this
# should not be a problem.

#
# This is the first PerlCleanupHandler in each site's .conf file
# (as written by install-slashsite).  This handler writes to the
# accesslog table.
